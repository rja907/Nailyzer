### Your health in your own hands!

> One-of-a-kind software that can be used as a Self-diagnostic tool without the help of a medical professional. Using Image Processing techniques, our algorithm extracts features based on color textures and irregularities of input image and outputs the detected symptoms of various



The users are required to upload images of their finger nails to the webserver. The webserver uses this uploaded files as input to the disease detection software.
The software uses digital image processing algorithms to analyse the images of nails of users. Machine Learning is used to further classify the dataset image on the basis of texture and color of the nails.


As a nail is unique to every person, there are many body organs such as eyes and tongue whose images can be used to determine symptons of even a fatal disease in its early stages.

## Requirements ##
1) Octave or Matlab
2) Nail Image Dataset ( You can use your own dataset to train as well )
